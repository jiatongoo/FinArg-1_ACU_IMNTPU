the thing that we are seeing is, quite frankly, all of these are growing but the most interesting thing for me as a pattern is growth in IaaS leads to growth in other PaaS services or SaaS services.",

gross margins we did has the mix shift to the cloud, I think we\u2019re all quite proud of.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 523, "sentence": "And so I think we would be foolish to change our plans.",

the new global program, global Prime Video is becoming more global with the launch in India as well.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 549, "sentence": "So in Q1 of this year, subscription services

E3 or ultimately to E5 you will continue to see and have headroom in that number but you are right, we are encouraged by the ARPU growth and the value proposition that has customers choosing the premium SKUs and continuing to choose those premium SKUs over time.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 616, "sentence": "So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing is increasing, what I would call, annuity

sales of the Watch did exceed our expectations and they did so despite supply still trailing demand at the end of the quarter.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 625, "sentence": "But the way we think about it is trying to price a reasonable price for the value that we deliver and I feel that we did that.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 626, "sentence": "In terms of the upgrade program itself, I

private interactions around payments and commerce and interacting with businesses in that way, I think what we\u2019re going this is we\u2019re going to build more tools for people to buy things

so what we provide in terms of both the technology and the business model I think shows up with the maximum flexibility.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 762, "sentence": "So when you can both add to your install base and add overall market opportunity, we do feel good about our line of sight in that business for our long-term goals.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 763, "sentence": "We're focusing more on shorter-form content to start.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 764, "sentence": "So I think the fact that we've already gotten 2 million advertisers to move into Stories is because we've gotten better at making it easier.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 765, "sentence": "The second factor is just anticipated changes that mobile platforms will make that will make targeting and measurement more

confidence headed into this holiday season that this is going to be the best holiday season yet.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 773, "sentence": "So I would say, we do plan to continue to invest

as well.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 834, "sentence": "So what we're seeing from DPA ads and carousel ads, we're really happy with.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 835, "sentence": "Obviously, those results would have been higher without some of the FX headwinds that Luca mentioned earlier.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 836, "sentence": "Our growth was really strong across all of our marketer segments, but we had a particularly good quarter in brands, I think driven by two things.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 837, "sentence": "And I would guess that that's going to accelerate into the future as the bundle breaks down and people begin to buy likely multiple services in place of their current cable bundle.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 838, "sentence": "And so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing that play out as we move forward.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 839, "sentence": "So that\u2019s contributing to some of the deceleration, specifically as we look out into the remainder of 2019.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 840, "sentence": "On head count, I would just point out that our payroll growth tends to lag head count growth, because head count is an end-of-period number, so the acceleration that we're seeing in 2017 will obviously play out in 2018 as well.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 841, "sentence": "So that's what we've designed it for.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 842, "sentence": "As you said, I think as we mentioned this in the release, we're definitely continuing to improve the experience in India for customers and sellers, excited by some of the response we've seen.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 843, "sentence": "But we feel fantastic, particularly as it pertains to iPhone X.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 844, "sentence": "So there is a lot of investment going on and there will be continued, especially related to Prime.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 845, "sentence": "Now our objective for the quarter wasn't primarily sales.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 846, "sentence": "The second component is what I would put in a bucket of new business.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 847, "sentence": "So it would be early to be talking about large shipment volumes.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 848, "sentence": "As you said, I mean at the midpoint of the range, we are essentially flat sequentially.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 849, "sentence": "Internationally, a lot of the same factors hold.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 850, "sentence": "And then of course, we are very excited about E5, but they're very, very early days of E5.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 851, "sentence": "This has been happening over multiple years, but we have now got very good customer momentum", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 852, "sentence": "So I would say that I would look back on the performance in 2018 and say that that was great work with a - on a lot of efficiency as we also banked a lot of capacity that had been built previously.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 853, "sentence": "And then our Cosmos DB has become the leading multi-model, multi-region database.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 854, "sentence": "So we're really pleased with what we're doing on the revenue front.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 855, "sentence": "So it's gone very well.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 856, "sentence": "And so, the amount of value creation for the customer by deployment is something that we ourselves are sort of really learning a lot each deployment, whether it's on the first line.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 857,

products.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 860, "sentence": "but the focus is really to build a rev-share model over time that's sustainable.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 861, "sentence": "The first thing is we're seeing longer commitments.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 862, "sentence": "To your second question on Office -- I'm sorry, on Windows Commercial overall, our real investment -- and

{"TestID": 864, "sentence": "But in general, inclusive of LinkedIn, I'm still around 100 bps.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 865, "sentence": "So all of those can impact it, Karl, as we look through the rest of the year.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 866, "sentence": "Yes, a couple things Brad.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 867, "sentence": "I think AR is big and profound and this is one of those huge things that we'll look back at and marvel on the start of it.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 868, "sentence": "And a lot of, I think, what we need to do is give people a way to see all of the videos that page that they like or follow is interested in sharing on Facebook.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 869, "sentence": "So, we\u2019re seeing strong growth across those platforms.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 870, "sentence": "And over the long-term, I think one of the big things that we need to do is see if we can not only make this good for engagement for our partners, but also a really positive business driver for them too.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 871, "sentence": "And those in addition to the U.S. price that has gotten more of a discussion had been extremely well received.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 872, "sentence": "We were significantly short at the beginning of the quarter.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 873, "sentence": "And the answer is, it\u2019s a little bigger, but it actually has the same amount of volatility quarter-to-quarter, so Q1 renewal base is actually almost equivalent to last year.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 874, "sentence": "So that's how we look at.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 875, "sentence": "And so, we plan on going in there with sort of all of our might.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 876, "sentence": "And so that's our focus, and I'm optimistic that \u2013 I don't know every play by play that will happen, but over time, I think that view will prevail.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 877, "sentence": "The challenge is always going to be cost and as we get better at this and get economies of scale, we lower those costs over time.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 878, "sentence": "So that's clearly going to stay.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 879, "sentence": "So it's a number of factors, I would say.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 880, "sentence": "It has been remarkable so far to see that we did take prices in a few markets.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 881, "sentence": "And so that's been really a great story for us.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 882, "sentence": "And renewals, as I mentioned earlier, we saw very good execution, not just on renewals in quarter, but really healthy behavior in terms of maybe expirations that we\u2019ve seen happen earlier in the year getting renewed, because of the new value prop and the commitment of the sales team to make sure that we landed a really thoughtful high customer value transaction.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 883, "sentence": "And so, that's the nature of a global supply chain.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 884, "sentence": "If anything, all the growth we have seen is in spite of that not being broadly revenue driving growth.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 885, "sentence": "So, a combination of being able to understand the text that people message, read the articles that people would want to look at, watch the videos, look at the photos, are going to be great, too.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 886, "sentence": "And we still believe that over time every phone sold will be a smartphone.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 887, "sentence": "And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 888, "sentence": "So we consider that a very strong quarter as down sequentially in the growth that we've seen recently.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 889, "sentence": "It's a very computationally and resource-intensive set of services that we provide and we need to build that out.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 890, "sentence": "Instagram has more heavy usage of Stories, so that's an area of continued growth opportunity because the effective levels of monetization in Stories are lower.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 891, "sentence": "So I would say the Prime membership to Prime flywheel, the additional benefits we are adding to Prime, not only in North America but also Internationally, and additional selection both retail and FBA which feeds the Prime flywheel.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 892, "sentence": "But our approach frankly is not

"sentence": "On Millennials, we were really pleased \u2013", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 895, "sentence": "And there can be timing, quarter-to-quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but certainly continue to expand.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 896, "sentence": "But the core of our focus is still very much focused on ads and how we can do ads at the product level.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 897, "sentence": "On EGM growth, I won't call out any particular categories, but it is a direct reflection of our efforts to grow selection, both our retail selection and also our third party, particularly FBA which is also Prime eligible and then just the responsiveness of our customers, especially our Prime customers to the EGM product line.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 898, "sentence": "In terms of larger developers, if you step back and look at the value proposition for people from the App Store, there are two key constituencies in that equation.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 899, "sentence": "We also are incredibly happy to see the highest Android switcher rate that we've observed.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 900, "sentence": "Pain points and improvements, I would say, our priorities include improving the usability of our tools for advertisers, helping make smarter recommendations for customers.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 901, "sentence": "Yes, we're very excited about the partnership with Adobe.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 902, "sentence": "So I would say that is a continuation of last year.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 903, "sentence": "And the advantage of that is also that some of those can be single player experiences.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 904, "sentence": "And so our task is to convince people that currently \u2013 or have another type of phone to switch, while really taking care of people that have an iPhone so that they choose \u2013 when they elect to buy another phone, that they buy another iPhone.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 905, "sentence": "So we're seeing a lot of strength.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 906, "sentence": "Just jumping on the Alexa point, I mean, I think the short answer is we don't have any plans to add paid advertising to Alexa.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 907, "sentence": "So we're very ready to go.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 908, "sentence": "So we think about this part more holistically, and same thing with Dynamics.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 909, "sentence": "And we agree that we are underpenetrated there.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 910, "sentence": "And then we believe that by creating that growth (17:19) and engaging advertising experience with the customers, it will also maximize success for our advertisers.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 911, "sentence": "As you've seen, we guided up sequentially in revenue.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 912, "sentence": "It's true in North America and our more developed markets within Europe, but I wouldn't say there's any real surprises there.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 913, "sentence": "We expect to make steady progress quickly and through the year.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 914, "sentence": "So all of those trailing 12-month metrics actually stayed the same or slightly declined in Q1.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 915, "sentence": "And so I think in this cycle, we've learned that customers want innovative products and we sort of already knew that in other cycles and other points in times, but it just puts an exclamation point by that I believe with looking at the results.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 916, "sentence": "I think this is going to be an exciting year.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 917, "sentence": "At the same time, within the services portfolio that we have, we have services that have different levels of profitability, so we also need to take into account the mix of services that we're going to be selling.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 918, "sentence": "So even going forward, there's going be revenue share back to the content creator, so it's going have a different margin structure than the core business.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 919, "sentence": "And so I think we\u2019ll be able to show the progress we\u2019ve made over every quarter, and give you some goals going forward.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 920, "sentence": "So really in that segment, it's the PC weakness in our traditional transactional Office business that's impacting that segment.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 921, "sentence": "You know one of our areas of focus is expanding our video and OTT offerings for brands.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 922, "sentence": "And so what that shows is our growth is being driven by the ability of us to do this broad-based consumer media advertising but do it in a more targeted way.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 923, "sentence": "And then CapEx, we'll see continue to flow in through the P&L over time.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 924, "sentence": "And so we think that certainly we want to provide the best advertising, we certainly want to provide the best measurement, but our ability to do so as long as things happen across the industry, which is what's happening, I think we remain in a very strong position.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 925, "sentence": "And for that reason, we think mid-roll is a better user experience.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 926, "sentence": "So we would expect expense growth to ramp throughout the year, largely due to the factors that we've talked about on prior calls in terms of what's driving the overall acceleration.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 927, "sentence": "So this year we're expecting a sequential decline of 220 basis points.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 928, "sentence": "Watch and AirPods are doing incredibly well.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 929, "sentence": "The geos I specifically called out obviously were we're the most impacted and they're the bigger geos.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 930, "sentence": "So you will see more going forward.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 931, "sentence": "And once we get that to a big base, then there are going to be a lot of opportunities to build a business, and the business will be proportional to the amount of that

"Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 933, "sentence": "Obviously, there's a lot of things that can happen in Q4 from weather to demand patterns changing.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 934, "sentence": "I think it's possible to get to the point in the next five to 10 years where we have computer systems that are better than people at each of those things.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 935, "sentence": "We're very happy with that.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 936, "sentence": "Even this quarter is a great example.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 937, "sentence": "but we believe there are going to be opportunities as we further scale those properties.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 938, "sentence": "So I think that's going to constantly be a thing that plays into the desktop revenue.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 939, "sentence": "So let's start with the $239 million; that is essentially where attributable to warrants that we have in companies that we partnered with.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 940, "sentence": "So we're currently going through the process of figuring out what we want to invest in over the next year and doing our long-range planning, and this is certainly one of the areas where I think we want to be investing a lot more in and believe that there's a big opportunity and can accelerate all the effort.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 941, "sentence": "Along with that, goes the advertising opportunities.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 942, "sentence": "Then, on top of it, we even have modernization of apps that is accelerating.",

be able to get those up and running quite quickly.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 946, "sentence": "In terms of growing channel inventory, in particular on iPhone where we\u2019re outside of it, we wouldn\u2019t expect to see a large step function increase.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 947, "sentence": "I mean, we obviously are focused on hiring top engineering talent.", "Prediction": 0},

that actually to continue in Q2.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 950, "sentence": "I mean, these are really privacy-first products, and I think that, that's kind of the most important way that we're thinking about this whole space overall.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 951, "sentence": "And I think you're going to be able to look at these transparency reports as we issue them and see that we're continually making more progress, finding more of the content proactively, taking - getting better at taking it down, getting better at not distributing stuff that's borderline.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 952, "sentence": "We're encouraged by the improvements we've seen year over year.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 953, "sentence": "And we're going to invest both in people and technology",

"Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 955, "sentence": "So there's a lot of room to expand that and that's just a big opportunity for the Internet overall and for India over the next decade and we hope to play a role in that.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 956, "sentence": "It would be a huge difference.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 957, "sentence": "The improvement in that in Q3 is obviously very high margin and also the bottom.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 958, "sentence": "We can also invest selectively because we have more perfect information we know where our demand is, we know where we're moving things between warehouses and sort centers and by not involving third parties all the time, we can find that we can extend our ship cut offs, or excuse me, our order cutoffs and we've done that over the last few years.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 959, "sentence": "So, I'd say, we're around the second phase of that in search now.", "Prediction": 0}, {"TestID": 960, "sentence": "Overall, we
